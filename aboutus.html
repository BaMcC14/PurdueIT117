	The Herd is a family friendly family-owned steakhouse. Our stakes are sourced from our family-owned farm and guaranteed to be fresh. With help from local farms, we can provide garden-fresh produce to use in our dishes. This gives us the best tasting food around. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The goal of The Herd is to provide a family friendly environment that provides top quality food at reasonable prices. At The Herd we also want to provide opportunity and success for all of our local family farms. We want every customer to not feel like a customer but more like family.  
	</p>
	<p>
	The family-farm has been in place for 5 generations. We have a passion for food and family, which is why a restaurant made sense for our next adventure. The restaurant officially opened in 2019 and has been a success ever since. The Herd has been featured in the local newspaper as a &#34;Top 5 must eat places in 2020&#34;.
	</p>
	<p>
	For 5 generations we have been working hard on the farm. Our farm has grown and is able to provide the restaurant with all the meat we could need. The meat from the farm is butchered and brought right to the restaurant. This meat is used to deliver the best steaks around. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Local family farms provide the dairy and produce we use in our dishes. Having fresh, not processed food delivers an unmatched flavor. Supporting us supports our farm and other local family farms.
